# Backend Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to convert the KU-ONLINE project from a full-stack application to a frontend-only application with mock data.

## Files Removed
- `.firebaserc` - Firebase configuration file
- `README.supabase.md` - Supabase setup documentation
- `README.replit.md` - Replit-specific documentation

## Files Modified

### `src/next.config.ts`
- Removed Firebase storage hostname from image remote patterns
- Kept only essential image sources (placehold.co, picsum.photos)

### `README.md`
- Updated project description to reflect frontend-only nature
- Removed backend service references
- Added features list highlighting mock data usage
- Changed title from "Starter" to "Frontend"

### `src/components/product/similar-items.tsx`
- Updated comment to clarify frontend-only demo nature
- Fixed type mismatch by removing `rating` property from seller objects
- Maintained mock data functionality

## What Remains
- All UI components and layouts
- Mock data for products and categories
- Frontend functionality (filtering, navigation, etc.)
- Theme support and responsive design
- Standard Next.js configuration

## Mock Data
The application now uses comprehensive mock data including:
- 8 sample products with realistic Kurdish marketplace data
- Product categories (Electronics, Fashion, Home & Garden, etc.)
- Seller information with avatars
- Location data (Erbil, Sulaymaniyah, Duhok, Zaxo)
- Product conditions and pricing in IQD

The application is now ready to run as a frontend-only demo and can be easily integrated with any backend service when needed.
