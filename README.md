## Supabase storage setup

Image uploads for product listings rely on a Supabase Storage bucket. The frontend defaults to a bucket named `product-images` (or the value of `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`). Create the bucket once in your Supabase project and ensure it is public:

1. Open the [Supabase dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) for your project.
2. Navigate to **Storage â†’ Buckets** and click **New bucket**.
3. Enter `product-images` as the name (or the bucket name you have configured in `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`).
4. Enable **Public bucket** so that listing photos can be displayed without authentication.
5. (Optional) Set a file size limit and allowed MIME types that suit your marketplace.
6. Save the bucket and, if required, add [Storage policies](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage#policies) that allow authenticated users to upload objects.

After the bucket exists, image uploads from the sell form will succeed. If uploads still fail, double-check the environment variables in `.env.local` for your Supabase URL, anon key, and storage bucket name.
